# Anchor: Concept + Boundaries

Anchor is a tiny “Single Source Of Truth” dashboard. It exists to show project reality in one screen:
- Status (active / parked / dormant)
- Current objective (one sentence)
- Next action (one concrete step)
- Links (tesseract / repo / logs / docs)

## What Anchor is NOT
- No task trees or project management boards
- No logs, journaling, or timeline history
- No analytics or reporting layers
- No multiple roles beyond admin

Anchor stays small and opinionated so the dashboard stays fast, readable, and trustworthy.
